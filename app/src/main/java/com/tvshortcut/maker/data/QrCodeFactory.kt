/**
 * Renders a URL as a QR code bitmap.
 *
 * A TV has no keyboard worth typing a link on, so the donation page is offered
 * as a code the viewer scans with a phone. Two details matter for that to work
 * across a living room:
 *
 *  - **white background, black modules** — cameras cope badly with inverted or
 *    low-contrast codes, so the code stays light even though the app is dark;
 *  - **generous module size** — the bitmap is rendered at the requested pixel
 *    size with no smoothing, keeping the edges of each module crisp when the
 *    launcher scales it up.
