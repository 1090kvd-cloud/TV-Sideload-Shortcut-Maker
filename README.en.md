## 🤔 The problem

Android TV's launcher only shows apps that declare `CATEGORY_LEANBACK_LAUNCHER`
in their manifest. Sideload a phone-only app — a browser, a torrent client, an
IPTV player — and it installs perfectly fine but **stays invisible**. The usual
workarounds are ugly file managers or ad-riddled "app drawer" apps.

**TV Sideload Shortcut Maker** finds those hidden apps, generates a proper
shortcut from the app's own icon and installs it on the home screen as a real app.
It also works as a fast, good-looking app drawer on its own.

## ✨ Features

| | |
|---|---|
| 🔍 **Full device scan** | Lists every installed package, including apps with no leanback entry point |
| 🎯 **Smart filters** | `Hidden on TV` · `All apps` · `TV apps` · `Favorites`, each with a live count |
| 🖼 **Original icon** | Pulled straight out of the APK and used untouched: square for `android:icon`, letterboxed into 16:9 for `android:banner` |
| 🎨 **Icon as-is** | The app's original icon, no gradients or overlaid text — the shortcut looks like a normal app |
| 📌 **Pinned shortcuts** | `ShortcutManagerCompat.requestPinShortcut()` with a launch-proxy trampoline |
| 🚀 **Built-in drawer** | Launch anything directly, even when the launcher refuses to pin shortcuts |
| 🗂 **My shortcuts** | A dedicated tab listing every generated shortcut, with a delete button so none get stranded |
| ⭐ **Favorites** | Persisted locally, always one D-Pad press away |
| 🎮 **Made for the remote** | Focus scale-up, animated outlines, depth shadows, 5 % overscan-safe padding |
| 🌑 **Dark by default** | Near-black background with violet/blue accents — easy on OLED panels |
| 📱 **Phones too** | Portrait layout, column count follows screen width, detail panel goes full screen |

## 🏗 Architecture

Classic **MVVM**, no DI framework — a hand-rolled `AppContainer` keeps the sample
easy to read and copy.

```
UI (Compose for TV)  ──observes──▶  AppListViewModel  ──calls──▶  Repository / Helpers
      │                                    │                              │
  AppDrawerScreen                    StateFlow<AppListUiState>       AppRepository
  AppDetailPanel                                                     BannerFactory
  AppCard / TvControls                                               ShortcutHelper
                                                                     FavoritesStore
```

**How a shortcut actually works**

```
TV launcher ──▶ pinned shortcut ──▶ LaunchProxyActivity ──▶ target app
                (icon + label)       (resolves the intent)
```

The proxy activity is transparent and `noHistory`, so the user never sees it. The
indirection means the shortcut survives target-app updates and can fall back
between the leanback and the phone entry point.

## 🛠 Tech stack

- **Kotlin 2.0.21** + Coroutines
- **Jetpack Compose for TV** (`androidx.tv:tv-material:1.0.0`)
- **AndroidX Palette** for accent-colour extraction
- **MVVM** with `StateFlow` / `collectAsStateWithLifecycle`
- AGP 8.7.2 · Gradle 8.9 · JDK 17

## 🚀 Build

The Gradle wrapper is committed, so no local Gradle installation is needed —
only **JDK 17** and the **Android SDK** (platform 35 + build-tools).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-name>/TV-Sideload-Shortcut-Maker.git
cd TV-Sideload-Shortcut-Maker

./gradlew assembleDebug
# → app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Or just open the folder in **Android Studio Ladybug (2024.2)+** and hit ▶.

<details>
<summary>Release build with your own signing key</summary>

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore release.keystore -alias tvshortcut \
        -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

./gradlew assembleRelease
```
</details>

## 🤖 CI — the APK builds itself

`.github/workflows/build.yml` assembles a debug APK on every push and uploads it
as a workflow artifact, so you never have to install the Android SDK locally.

```bash
# push the project and let GitHub build it
./push-to-github.sh                 # needs the GitHub CLI: gh auth login

gh run watch                        # follow the build
gh run download --name tv-shortcut-maker-debug   # grab the APK
```

Pushing a tag additionally publishes a GitHub Release with the APK attached:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0
```

## 📦 Prebuilt APK

A signed build is available in [releases](https://github.com/1090kvd-cloud/TV-Sideload-Shortcut-Maker/releases/latest) — no need to
build it yourself.

Every release is signed with the same key, so updates install over the previous
version. A debug build installed earlier must be removed once: the signatures
differ and Android refuses to update across them.

## 📥 Install on a TV

```bash
# 1. Enable Developer options → USB/Network debugging on the TV
# 2. Find the TV's IP in Settings → Network
adb connect 192.168.1.42:5555
adb install -r app-debug.apk
```

Alternatively, sideload the APK with *Downloader (AFTV)*, *Send files to TV*, or a
USB stick.

> ⚠️ **First launch:** on Android 11+ the app needs `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` to see
> your sideloaded apps. It is a normal install-time permission — no prompt — but
> it is why this app is not distributed through Google Play.

## 🧭 Usage

1. Open **TV Shortcut Maker** from the home screen.
2. The default **Hidden on TV** filter already shows the apps the launcher hides.
3. Highlight an app → **OK** opens the detail panel (**long press OK** launches it instantly).
4. Check the preview, then **Add to home screen**.
5. Confirm the launcher's pin dialog. Done.

## ⚠️ Known limitations

- **Pinning depends on the launcher.** Google TV and most AOSP TV launchers accept
  pinned shortcuts; some vendor skins (a few Xiaomi/Realme builds) silently ignore
  the request. The in-app drawer and **Favorites** cover that case — the app will
  tell you when pinning is unsupported.
- Mobile apps not designed for TV may render in portrait, ignore the D-Pad, or
  require a mouse. Pair a remote-with-mouse app if needed; this is a limitation of
  the target app, not of the shortcut.
- **Generated shortcuts are separate packages.** Uninstalling this app does not
  remove them — clear them from the "My shortcuts" tab first.
- `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` is a restricted permission on Google Play. This project is
  meant for sideloading / F-Droid style distribution.

## 🗺 Roadmap

- [ ] Custom artwork picker (load your own PNG/JPG for a shortcut)
- [ ] Channel/row publishing via `TvProvider` for launchers without pin support
- [ ] Batch shortcut creation
- [ ] Search with the on-screen keyboard
- [ ] Backup/restore of favorites

## ❤️ Support the project

This app is free, ad-free and collects no data — and it will stay that way.

- ☕ [Boosty](https://boosty.to/tvshortcutmaker/donate) — one-off donation, any amount
- ⭐ Free but just as useful: star the repo and tell others about it

Donations go towards test devices (TV boxes from different vendors behave very
differently) and the time spent chasing bugs.
